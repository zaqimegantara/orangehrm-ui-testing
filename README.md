* **Non-Functional Testing**: Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
* **Automated Testing**: Selenium WebDriver with Python & Pytest
* **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions with headless browser testing
* **Acceptance Testing**: User-based validation aligned with user expectations
* **Screenshot Logging**: Visual logs for all test cases
* **Testing Metrics**: 100% pass rate, full coverage
